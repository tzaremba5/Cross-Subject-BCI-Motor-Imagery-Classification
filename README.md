# Cross Subject BCI Motor Imagery Classification

## Introduction
In this paper, we propose a method of assimilating all the subject's data across three datasets: BCI Competition IV Dataset I, IIa and BCI competition III Dataset IVa. After, we get a baseline accuracy using the single-trial framework to prove that the assimilation step did not drastically alter that subject's data. After this, we use the data to pretrain other subjects both within the same dataset (CSWD) and with subjects across the other datasets (CSCD). Our hypothesis is that a unique pattern in the EEG data would allow a model to correctly classify MI tasks for most people with this extra data.
